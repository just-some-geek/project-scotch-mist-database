**An Introduction to the Scotch Mist Project Worldbuilding Wiki**
*For Team Members' Eyes Only*

The following series of documents is a Wikipedia-style encyclopedia detailing the world built for the Scotch Mist Project. These are written to serve as a guide for the developers, artists, actors, musicians, and other team members in constructing a more immersive rendition of this world.

All files are written to be an unbiased and accurate summary of events, people, and places relevant to the story. Any inaccuracies in transposing the content into the game and other media should be done with intention to reinforce the game's core themes of diversity in perspectives. Any inconsistencies in information between files is probably a mistake on the writer's end or an artefact of a previous version that has yet to be updated.
## Class-Tier File Designation System
---
For convenience, files are sorted using an alphanumeric Class-Tier system, detailed below:
#### Tier
is a numeric designation that indicating a file's importance or relevance to the story.

| Tier | Importance | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| :--: | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | Critical   | Absolutely essential files that establish the setting's foundations. Essential reading for all team members.                                    |
|  2   | High       | Major files that have significant influence on the happenings of the world. Need-to-know information that should be revealed at the right time. |
|  3   | Medium     | Minor files that contribute to the world, but not in a drastic way. Nice-to-know information that doesn't necessarily need to be shown.         |
|  4   | Low        | Deep historical background, technical jargon, and off-screen content that enhance the experience, but are hardly influential.                   |
|  5   | Negligible | Minor tidbits and trinkets that have near-zero plot relevance, but may provide background information and fun trivia,                           |
#### Class
is a letter designation describing the type of information contained in a file. Note that a file can have more than one letter designation if deemed necessary.

| Class | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Things You'll Need
---
You're going to need to install the following Obsidian plugins/themes:
[Git (Plugin)](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git)
[Style Settings (Plugin)](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

[Wikipedia (Theme)](https://github.com/Bluemoondragon07/Wikipedia-Theme)

If you don't have one already, you're also going to need a [Baybayin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin) font, since some articles contain the script. I'd recommend [Niwang Uno](https://filipeanut.gumroad.com/l/baybayinfontniwanguno) by Filipeanut, but any Baybayin font should work.

Remember: our goal is to create a consistent, fleshed-out world for our audience to immerse themselves in. We are not here to lore-dump about the intricate details of Sterlian governance, the inner workings of a reprogrammable key card, or the endless anachronisms that our setting has. Use your best judgement in deciding when and how, or even if, this content is used.

For further reading, I'd recommend looking at the following pages next:

[[Scotch Mist The Game - An Overview]]

You're also going to need to install Obsidian and the following plugins/themes:

I wish you the best of luck, and hope that we can make something beautiful together.
