**War in Shenzhou from 1926-1959**

The **Shenzhou War**, also known as the **Far Eastern Emergency**, was an armed conflict fought on the [[Shenzhou]] mainland and the Sterlian-controlled [[Chendai Archipelago]] between [[North Shenzhou]] (Federation of Shenzhou) and [[South Shenzhou]] (People's Republic of Shenzhou) and their allies.

The fighting spilled into the [[Kaigaishiman Crisis]] in 1957, which further escalated into the **Great Eastern War** in 1958.
