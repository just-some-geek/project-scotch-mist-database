**Operation Divine Wind** (Eikan: 神風作戦, *Kamikaze Sasuken*) was the Eikan invasion and occupation of Kaigaishima as part of their 1958 spring offensive. Following the fall of [[Chendai]] on the Shenzhen mainland, a section of the Eikan military would be diverted to secure the rest of the [[Chendai Archipelago]], up to and including the nominally neutral territory of Sterlian-owned Kaigaishima.
