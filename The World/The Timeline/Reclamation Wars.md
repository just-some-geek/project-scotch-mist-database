The **Reclamation Wars** were a series of colonial conflicts and interventions fought by the [[Sterlian Commonwealth]] in the aftermath of the [[Great War]]. The main objective of the campaign was to "reclaim the regions of the world which have fallen to anarchy" and (re-)integrate them into the Sterlian Empire's (and later [[Sterlian Commonwealth|Commonwealth's]]) sphere of influence.

While support for the "war on anarchy" was high among the Sterlian public during its initial years, it had become deeply unpopular by the late 1930s. Controversy over the war has focused on its morality, casualties, and continuity, with critics questioning government measures that infringed civil liberties and human rights.
