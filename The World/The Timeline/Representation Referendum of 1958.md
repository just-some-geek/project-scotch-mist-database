**1958 Sterlian referendum on home rule in the Commonwealth Periphery**

The **Representation Referendum of 1958**, commonly referred to as the **Home Rule Referendum**, was a referendum that took place on 9 April 1958 in the [[Sterlian Commonwealth]] under the provisions of the [[Representation Act of 1933]] to determine whether the [[Territories of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Commonwealth territories]] under direct rule from [[Great Sterlia]] should be granted the right to self-governance. It is among the landmark events that lead up to the [[Kaigaishiman Crisis]] and the end of the [[Shenzhou War]].

The referendum was called after the [[Sterlian Parliament]] failed to act on proposed modifications to the Representation Act of 1933, which sought to enact home rule across all territories of the Commonwealth. The law stalled for a year after its initial drafting, which allowed [[Labour Party|Labour]] to invoke the Referendum Clause of the [[Sterlian Charter]].

The election was marred by substantial irregularities, repression of the pro-home rule campaign and manipulation of votes. In the end, the result was a vote marginally in favor of remaining under direct rule, though this would be contested by the pro-home rule camp, citing large-scale fraud.
