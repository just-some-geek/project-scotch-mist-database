## Background
---
The formation of the [[Sterlian Commonwealth|Sterlian Commonwealth]] is rooted in the Representation Movement of the late 1850s, wherein major colonies of the Sterlian Empire campaigned, in general, for a better position within it. These included calls for greater autonomy of the colonies, equal rights among its citizens, and political representation within [[Sterlian Parliament|Parliament]].

While minor concessions were granted at the Imperial Council of 1857, it was determined that only the most major colonies, now the [[Dominions of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Dominions]], were ready for self-governance.
## Consolidation
---
The period from 1857 to 1907 saw the centralization of territorial control and administration in the colonies, with the dissolution of the old estate system and the East Sinoti Company

## Road to Establishment
---
On 10 June 1933, Parliament would pass the Representation Act of 1933 by a narrow margin.

>
>For nineteen years, brave men from across the Empire have fought on, side by side, on every continent, in every conflict, to bring peace and stability to a shattered world. By their blood, the Sterlian people stand as the rulers of the world, and I believe that it is time we acknowledged as much.
>
>Gentlemen, the Constitution that we voted upon this day seeks to honor the brave sons of the Empire, from Borealis to Ozbourne. It seeks to set right the injustices of the old world, and to bring forth a new era of peace, prosperity, and liberty for the peoples of the Sterlian Empire, and the world.
>
>The Sterlian Empire is no more. Long live the Commonwealth!
