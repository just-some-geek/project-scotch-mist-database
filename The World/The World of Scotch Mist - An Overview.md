### The Setting
---
Scotch Mist takes place on [[Kaigaishima]] (legally distinct Hong Kong/Singapore), a distant colony of the [[Sterlian Commonwealth]] (legally distinct British Empire). The island is a cultural hot-pot, with significant populations from mainland [[Shenzhou]] (China), [[Eikan Empire|Eiko]] (Japan), [[The Isabelines]] (UY PHILIPPINES), and the rest of the Commonwealth and the Far East.

The outbreak of the [[Shenzhou War]] between the communist [[South Shenzhou]] and the "democratic" warlord-state coalition of [[North Shenzhou]] has dragged the overstretched Commonwealth into a long war of attrition against the red tide. An increasingly desperate [[Sterlian Parliament|Parliament]] has been taking drastic measures to try to win, but have only succeeded in angering the under-represented populations of frontline Commonwealth states, especially Kaigaishima.

The social, economic, and political tensions in the island are ready to boil over into the wider world, and there are many groups who are poised to take advantage of the weakened state of the Commonwealth. All they need to do is wait...
### The People
---
The game is an account of the [[Kaigaishiman Crisis]] from the perspectives of four people:

- [[Olivia Northwind]], a Sterlian government official and daughter of Admiral [[Nelson Charles Northwind|Nelson Northwind]], who commands the Sterlian forces in the Shenzhou Theatre. She's desperate to prove that she's just as capable as her father, but her long list of self-earned accolades are only met with accusations of nepotism and general misogyny. May or may not have a drinking problem...

- [[Li Zenghui]], a Shenzhou-Kaigai expatriate returning to his homeland. He's traveled all over the world, gathering knowledge and contacts to help him achieve his dream: opening a school in his hometown. He's active in promoting social, political, and economic reforms that benefit the general population, but seems to have associated himself with a rather radical crowd...

- [[Basilio Liwanag]], a Sabelinyo scholar who came to Kaigaishima to pursue a degree in civil engineering. He wants to become successful in the academic world, make his family and country proud, and give back to the people that raised him. Despite all that he's gotten in life so far, he's still unsure how much of these achievements are his own...

- [[Yukio Yamada]], an Eikan refugee who fled to Kaigaishima to escape the stiff, militaristic culture of his homeland. After partially assuming a false identity via his missing friend, he nabs a scholarship at [[Paul Miki University]] and the chance to finally find a place to call home. However, Kaigaishima isn't quite the bastion of freedom he and his friend dreamed of...

Along their journey they will meet the people of Kaigaishima, uncover far-reaching conspiracies, fight for civil rights, and taste the greatest chorizo of their lives. 
### The Story

>*Main Article: [[Kaigaishiman Crisis|The Kaigaishiman Crisis]]*

The game's timeline takes place between the dates of 1 June 1957 and 6 May 1958. Dates for the major events are generally pinned down, but the exact sequence and timing of events are dependent on a player's choices throughout the story.

#### ACT 1: Cloud Watching
The player characters arrive on the island on 1 June 1957, as [[Kaigaishima]] is preparing for the [[Summer Festival]] (23 June). The [[Sterlian Commonwealth Armed Forces|Sterlian military]] is scaling up conscription to support their operations in [[Shenzhou]], which involves a series of recruitment drives across the island through July and September.

On 21 Sept., the government announces that a general referendum will be held on 9 January to break the political deadlock in [[Sterlian Parliament|Parliament]] over a bill granting more political representation to the colonies. This, along with a few other announcements (including an escalation in the Shenzhou War and a corresponding cut to public works on Kaigaishima), stir up controversy among the general public.

#### ACT 2: Cold Front
On 11 Nov., [[Remembrance Day]], the Sterlian military launches a mass offensive in Shenzhou, hoping to break the communist frontline. However, the rapid failure of the offensive prompts an investigation into corruption and/or treason within the military and government. Additionally, particularly active political groups on Kaigaishima are placed under surveillance for potential collaboration with the [[Eikan Empire]].

On 19 Dec. a [[Olivia Northwind|whistleblower]] within the Sterlian government leaks information regarding the Commonwealth's corruption and war crimes in Shenzhou. This includes budget cuts to public works and humanitarian aid, the use of chemical weapons, and intentional targeting of civilian centers. The government denies these allegations and states they will "investigate the matter and bring these monsters to justice."

On 25 Dec., Christmas Day, a series of terrorist bombings hit government-related buildings across Kaigaishima, including the Navy headquarters at [[Admiralty Park]], the officer's club at the [[Albertine Valley Country Club]], the [[Imperial Broadcasting Service]] complex at [[Fort Valkyrie]], and the government offices at [[City Hall]]. In response, the government launches an investigation and locks down the island, with Martial Law to take effect on 1 Jan. 1958.

#### ACT 3: Crisis Imminent
Despite the restrictions, the Representation Referendum still takes place on 9 Jan. Several "issues" delay the vote counting and stalls out the release of the results for almost a month. On 6 Feb., the results of the referendum came out an overwhelming "no". This is hotly contested by parts of the general public, and protests break out across Kaigaishima in violation of martial law restrictions. The Sterlian military cracks down hard on the protesters, arrests and detains several dozen, and temporarily puts a halt to dissident activity.

For the next month and a half, the situation on Kaigaishima and the wider Far East continues to deteriorate. The Sterlian military is slowly surrounded in [[Chendai]], Eikan collaborators organize resistance groups against the government, and an unhappy populace gears up for another round of protests to bring the Shenzhou War to an end.

On 9 April, an anti-war protest at [[Paul Miki University]] is broken up when government forces fire on the students, killing 4 and wounding 17. This triggers mass rioting to break out across south, western, and central Kaigaishima, with major institutions, government buildings, and military positions being attacked. 

With the fall of Chendai on 12 April, Eikan troops stationed in the city make their way across the strait to southwest Kaigaishima. They, along with Eikan-backed resistance cells, take control of the western and southern districts to "pacify the region". Commonwealth forces retreat into the richer eastern and northern districts, and begin negotiations for a full withdrawal from Kaigaishima. On 6 May 1958, the Sterlian Commonwealth, with assistance from the [[Columbia|Columbian Federation]], withdraws its government and military from Kaigaishima (ala Fall of Saigon).
