Introductory Text :  
With a curious mind, his knack of learning has led him to seek education on this island.

Some things must never be known…  
  

Overview : 

  

Basilio is a scholar from the Isabelines who's pursuing an electrical engineering degree in Kaigaishima's biggest university SIU. He's a very intelligent and well rounded person whose only noticeable struggles can be seen in social situations. Yet even then it was never much of an issue for him.

  

Now while he had the opportunity to study in any school in the country due to his academic standing, he chose to leave for a scholarship opportunity abroad. Ask him, he complains about how his country handles education, saying that he wanted to see other nation's ways and perspectives.

  

It was lucky that he managed to land in Kaigaishima, probably the best place to learn different viewpoints, due to the island's diverse population.

  

Personality/Tidbits :

  

He is not passionate about politics

He can articulate his political opinion extremely well.

Too honest for his own good.

Eager to make friends, despite seeming shy.

Often bikes to places.

He is a great basketball player relative to his height and era, doesn’t mean anything he just knows how to play.

  
  

Opinion On : 

  
The Island - “It’s interesting to see how such different people can coexist in the same city. There’s a lot to be learned from cultures that aren’t your own.”

  
Himself - “I’m not that brilliant of a person, I do my best but I’m just one of the lucky ones.”

  
  

  
Olivia - “I normally don’t involve myself in political matters but Olivia I consider the exception. She makes the topic a lot less daunting when I talk to her about it.”

  
Yukio - “An interesting person, no other way to put it. He sees the world a lot differently than you or I do, not necessarily in a bad way. ”

  
  

  
Joseph - “He wishes for change and is confident in his ideas for change. Now while I agree with the man, I can’t help but play devil’s advocate sometimes.”

Basilio has always been known as “the smartest person in the room” so it’s no surprise that he landed a scholarship to a prestigious university led by a collection of the smartest minds in the empire. St. Ignatius was a school a lot of people have heard about over recent years due to them producing some of the most talented minds responsible for many technological and philosophical innovations.  
  
However in this school, he finds a different purpose, as one of his fellow dormers, a man named Willard Foker, took interest in his viewpoints regarding social issues. Willard noticed how well articulated his arguments were about every news topic Basilio happened to read on The Kingfisher, a local student newspaper.  
  
Often then conversations would come up when they drank at The Wildflour, a bar located in the center of the island, as that’s the only time Basilio would ever decide to speak his mind. If that’s how he talked drunk, how well could he debate sober?  
  
So being the main photographer of The Kingfisher, Willard decided to let Basilio into their operation, and not surprisingly Willard’s (Sparrow’s) intuition was spot on. Basilio soon became an editorial writer for The Kingfisher under the name Falco Peregrine, as well as the writer of an advice panel. Soon with the addition of Basilio, The Kingfisher skyrockets in popularity not only in the campus but across the island as well.  
  
With this newfound popularity, The Kingfisher expands its operations. Basilio’s point of no return is deciding with The Kingfishers whether or not to publish the Northwind papers, documents found by a government official Olivia Northwind. Documents that contained supposed proof that The Representation Referendum (A.P. 1080) is to be rigged towards a specific outcome.  
  
His story ends with him escaping the island with The Kingfishers on a fishing boat back to Isabela to recoup. Whether or not the Sterlians manage to push back the Eikan advance will be determined by other factors that Basilio may or may not influence.

### Quotes
---
Self Introduction:  
“Hm? Oh, my name is Basilio Liwanag. Yes, Liwanag. It’s okay if you can’t pronounce my name right away, most people don’t.”  

On My Name:
“My surname’s Liwanag. Lee-wah-nahg. Not Liwa-nag, not Lie-wa-nag. Li-wa-nag. It means ‘bright’, which is rather fitting if SIU had anything to say about it. Basilio on the other hand, I have no idea. You’ll get it eventually.”

On Kaigaishima:  
“The place is interesting, I will tell you that much. Coming from someone who had zero expectations of this island.”  
  
On SIU:  
“I’m inclined to believe that it is the best university here, it’s just a shame that the most privileged are the ones here. Not that they’re undeserving, it’s clear that they’re intelligent. I just know many who deserve it who can’t be here because of factors out of their control.”  
  
On Those Who Came Before Me:  
“Have you heard the Isaac Newton quote? ‘If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants?’ I feel that way a lot, but not really. It’s not giants I’m standing on, and it’s not seeing further, if that makes sense. I sit on the shoulders of a person who is sitting on the shoulders of another and so on. Down and down infinitely. I exist at all because of everyone before me, not just giants, not just the big important ones. The result of a million small things. When you look at the past, it’s humans all the way down. I’d change the quote to ‘If I exist at all, it's by resting on the hands of the dead’. Is that a stupid thing to say?”  
  
On Relationships:  
“Socializing is exhausting. This isn’t coming from a lack of desire, don’t think that. They’re bridges that require constant maintenance, and it’s easier when both sides help with the upkeep.”  
  
On Proximity:  
“The reason why friendships are born is because of closeness, but that doesn’t mean the two parties are actually friends. If they were truly friends, it would extend beyond the environment they’re forced to be in. Are you only friends because you’re coworkers, neighbors, classmates? Or is there something more?”
