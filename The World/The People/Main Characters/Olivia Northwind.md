Wants to prove herself to her peers.
  
Olivia has always been a hardworking person, but her achievements always fall short in the eyes of her peers and superiors. In an effort to prove herself, she gets herself assigned to a secretary position in an office placed in the far eastern parts of the Commonwealth. However the fact that that office is her own fathers doesn’t help with what she’s trying to do.  
  
Kaigaishima has always been a contentious topic amongst parliament due to its distance from the mainland as well as its proximity to other rising powers in the area, most notably The Empire of Eiko. Currently it’s been one of the fastest developing parts of the Commonwealth but with it’s development comes a lot of growing pains. In Olivia’s mind, if she can manage to bring some sort of stability to the island and uphold Sterlian values such as liberty, equality and democracy, it’ll advance her career and break the ‘glass ceiling’.

However, the more she gets involved with aspects such as policy and enforcement, the more she realizes that the Sterlian Commonwealth itself doesn’t uphold its own values. Eventually coming to a head when she discovers that The Representation Referendum is planned to be rigged.  

Her story ends with whether or not she decides to stay and help the island or whether or not she flees.

Self Introduction:
“Do you need something? No? Well regardless, my name is Olivia Northwind. Yes, that Northwind.”

On Admiral Northwind:
“My dad’s been working here for 10 years or so by this point. You’d think he’d take a break at some point to spend some time with his daughter, but no, he just gives me more work.”  
  
On Change:  
“‘Things change but stay the same’ sounds like an asinine saying, sadly I find it to be true. We’ll all have the same struggles, joys and situations, it will just have a different layer of paint on it. That’s what happens with people, we look different over the years but our nature is constant.”  
  
On The Faith:  
“I wish I believed, it would make things a lot more simple.”  
  
On Joseph:  
“He’s… earned my respect. I didn’t trust him at first but he’s shown time and time again that he is a capable man. I don’t know how he manages to keep going, would you believe me if I told you he played this ball game with Shenzhen kids in his spare time? The gall to be so carefree at a time like this.”
