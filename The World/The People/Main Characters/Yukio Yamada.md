# Dev Notes

With no place to call their own, hope draws them here.
College is a great place to reinvent yourself…  

Yukio Yamada is an illegal immigrant from [[Eikan Empire|Eiko]] who finds himself on a cargo ship en route to [[Kaigaishima]]. He had grown tired of his nation's rampant xenophobia and imperialism, so he decided to take himself elsewhere. Somewhere he could feel safer.  

Luckily for him, he managed to nab the documents necessary to apply for scholarship in the island’s 2nd best university, [[Paul Miki University|PMU]], granting him a free dormitory to live in. Granted he’d then have to attend classes and not fail, but he believes he could survive. These documents came from his friend, his real name as well as his friend's name is unknown.  
  
Electrical engineering seemed difficult, but he had experience with fixing radio and other appliances in his community.

Themselves - “I’m unsure, have you ever been unsure before? There’s a lot more I need to figure out first before I can answer that, sorry.”

# Character Story

Yukio never really had a terrible childhood, but there were many compounding things in life that never sat right with him. The nation he lived in, Eiko, while prospering in many ways materially had issues that he could not live with. Its rampant nationalism and racism was apparent, its strict hold on tradition and family made it hard for young people to just be. After he caught wind of the nation's plans to start a war of conquest, it was the straw that broke the camel's back for him.  
  
So he decided to flee the country, something that for some reason he was quite confident in. He plotted his course to Kaigaishima, an island that he felt was reachable due to it being a trade hub between Eiko and the Commonwealth. He felt a lot safer there, however he also knew that there was a chance that the island would be included in Eiko’s war, so Kaigaishima could also be used as a jumping off point to other countries such as [[The Isabelines]].  
  
The plan was to hide themselves in an empty wooden crate that had holes in them and ship himself on his way to Kaigaishima. He had also obtained documents through undisclosed sources that made him a scholar to the University of Paul Miki. This allowed him a safe place to live for the foreseeable years, as well as an education to give him job opportunities down the line. Granted he’d have to succeed in class, but the degree was for electrical engineering, something he felt confident in as he was his community's handyman for electrical appliances. 

He could be accompanied by a friend or two he wants to save, whether they end up on Kaigaishima with him or accidentally get shipped off somewhere else is to be determined.  

Arriving at the university he gets himself acclimated with the place, as well as forming connections and friendships with a diverse cast of people. Including [[Artemis Ellery Taylor]], a fellow student at PMU who has lived on the island for a bit longer than he has and introduces him to the university and shows him around. [[Rev. Thomas McKenzie]] residing parish priest of the university and [[Jose De Guzman]] owner of [[Chorizo Joe's Karinderia]], to whom Yukio chooses to confide in from time to time. 

Sometime later, they also meet a man by the name of Basilio, when going out to the [[Wildflour (bar)|Wildflour]] a bar owned by [[Damian Emmanuel Lasky|Damian Lasky]]. The two become quick friends and they meet frequently at the bar to chat, given their seemingly similar situations. Although Yukio lies about his side of the story when it's brought up.

After meeting each other, both are approached by a certain [[Willard Foker]], a friend of Basilio from his school [[St. Ignatius University]]. Willard proposes that Basilio joins [[The Kingfisher]] as a writer, Basilio agrees on the condition that Yukio comes along and given a role as well. From there they're given an investigative / photographer role, since the members of the Kingfisher noticed Yukio's ability to seemingly get around and sneak into areas without suspicion. Over his time working at The Kingfisher, they gain in popularity partly thanks to his work as well as Basilio's new role as a writer. 

Nearing the end of the year, The Kingfisher are then contacted by one Olivia Northwind, a government official. She brings to them evidence of government corruption, use of illegal chemical weapons in the [[Shenzhou War]], as well as a plan to rig the [[Representation Referendum of 1958|Referendum Vote]]. However the team is hesitant to accept Northwind's offer. To confirm her information they send out Yukio to "borrow" some documents from key government buildings, as well as record a meeting being held in the [[Albertine Valley Country Club]] between select military officials of the Commonwealth. 

After confirming that Northwind is in fact telling the truth, they scramble to collect enough documents and transcripts from her as well as organizing them in a way that's presentable to the public. As well as coordinating with [[Eleanor Carter|someone from within the Imperial Broadcasting Service]], to release it on December 19th. However a week after releasing the papers, a terrorist attack hits multiple government buildings on Christmas, shifting the public's attention away from [[The Northwind Papers]]. Additionally, as a response the government declared Martial Law, which was to be implemented at the start of the year. 

Due to both The Northwind Papers, the delay of the Referendum results as well as the declaration of Martial Law, protests and riots begin in and around PMU on the feast day of St. Paul Miki, the 6th of February 1958. These protests continue and slowly escalate in size and activity throughout the following months, The Kingfisher continues it's operations covering news from across the island during this time of uncertainty and unrest. Artemis also becomes a frequent attendee to these protests, despite raising safety concerns from many of her friends most of all Yukio.

It all comes to a head when on the 12th of April, a [[Paul Miki University Massacre|particularly unruly protest]] was cracked down on by police / military forces. Multiple students were shot and / or killed. This can include Artemis depending on the player's actions. This event sparks much outrage across the entire island as multiple institutional buildings are attacked by rioters, as well as the [[Operation Divine Wind|Eikan military arriving]] to help "liberate the island" after waiting for the opportunity to do so. All the while Yukio has yet to find his lost friend.

Faced with a tough decision, Yukio can either decide to flee to the Isabelines on his own per Basilio's suggestion, or stay with Father McKenzie and/or Artemis to aid the island.
