With no place to call their own, hope draws them here.

College is a great place to reinvent yourself…  
  
Overview :  
  
Yukio Yamamda is an illegal immigrant from Eiko who finds himself on a cargo ship en route to Kaigaishima. He had grown tired of his nation's rampant xenophobia and imperialism, so he decided to take himself elsewhere. Somewhere he could feel safer.  
  
Luckily for him, he managed to nab the documents necessary to apply for scholarship in the island’s 2nd best university PMU, granting him a free dormitory to live in. Granted he’d then have to attend classes and not fail, but he believes he could survive. These documents came from his friend the real Yukio Yamada, Yukio Alpha allowed this Yukio to take his name to use. His real name is unknown.  
  
Electrical engineering seemed difficult, but he had experience with fixing radio and other appliances in his community.  
  
Opinion On : 

  
The Island - “I need a place to be, this feels like a good spot.”

  
Themselves - “I’m unsure, have you ever been unsure before? There’s a lot more I need to figure out first before I can answer that, sorry.”

  
Basilio - “He explained to me how the trains worked here. He speaks like he’s the smartest person in the room, but not in a cocky way. I often go to him when I need to know things.”

  
Olivia - “I know she means well I know she means well but she has that look. I don't know if I'm getting pity or what, but she doesn't feel right.”
  
Joseph - “I don't really understand what he wants sometimes, he's got a lot going on.”

Yukio never really had a terrible childhood, but there were many compounding things in life that never sat right with him. The nation he lived in, Eiko, while prospering in many ways materially had issues that he could not live with. Its rampant nationalism and racism was apparent, its strict hold on tradition and family made it hard for young people to just be. After he caught wind of the nation's plans to start a war of conquest, it was the straw that broke the camel's back for him.  
  
So he decided to flee the country, something that for some reason he was quite confident in. He plotted his course to Kaigaishima, an island that he felt was reachable due to it being a trade hub between Eiko and the Commonwealth. He felt a lot safer there, however he also knew that there was a chance that the island would be included in Eiko’s war, so Kaigaishima could also be used as a jumping off point to other countries such as Isabela/The Isabelines.  
  
The plan was to hide themselves in an empty wooden crate that had holes in them and ship himself on his way to Kaigaishima. He had also obtained documents through undisclosed sources that made him a scholar to the University of Paul Miki. This allowed him a safe place to live for the foreseeable years, as well as an education to give him job opportunities down the line. Granted he’d have to succeed in class, but the degree was for electrical engineering, something he felt confident in as he was his community's handyman for electrical appliances.  
  

He could be accompanied by a friend or two he wants to save, whether they end up on Kaigaishima with him or accidentally get shipped off somewhere else is to be determined.

Self Introduction:  
“My name’s Yukio. Oh, you don’t need to shake my hand, there’s no need to be so formal. Who are you?”  
  
On Stress:  
“People are so angry nowadays, all caught up in their routines and things. I just wish people would make some time, take it easy. Not all the time, just sometimes.”  
  
On Time and the Future:  
“There was an old man who lived in the corner of the street I lived in. He was the kind of old man who would give you old man advice. When I was young he told me that there was no need to rush things. ‘The best is yet to come’.”  
  
On Learning Other Languages:  
“As a kid my parents sent me to a foreign-language school and our neighborhood had a lot of traders from other countries. I learned quickly, but I’m not as good as you think I am.”  
  
On Basilio:  
“Even though we go to different universities he’s been a huge help. I met him at a restaurant after we got into a fight with some fraternity guys.
  
On PMU:  
“It’s great! It was scary at first but the campus is really pretty and I’m learning a lot. I just hope they don't, you know. Find out..”

On National Pride:
“It's a common sentiment where I'm from. Eikans should honor their nation for our empire is holy, the emperor holy. If you go against the nation, you go against your fellow man. I'm not here to talk about religion but I don't think the nation works for fellow men.”
