Overview:
Father of Olivia Northwind, and the reason she’s accused of being a nepo-baby. He’s never pulled any strings for her, but his reputation and good standing does open the way for her more frequently than either would admit.

A hardline loyalist to the Crown, the Lord Admiral has served a long and distinguished career in the Royal Navy. He suffered a leg injury during the Battle of the Twin Straits, rendering him unfit for frontline service. He was promoted to this command about 10 years ago, and has spent that time organizing and preparing the fleet for a war he’s predicted ever since the end of the Great War.

When not on duty (which is basically never), he likes to attend horse races at the Alberteen Valley Country Club or go drinking at the bar down the street from the Royal Admiralty.
