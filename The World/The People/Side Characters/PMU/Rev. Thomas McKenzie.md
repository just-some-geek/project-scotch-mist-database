Self-Introduction:
“My name is Father McKenzie. I am but a humble servant of the Almighty One, speaking His word to the flock.”

On Faith:
“People want to believe in something, right? Whether it be the power of God or science or some grandiose conspiracy, people want to believe in something. I’m here to help them believe.”

On Personal Judgment:
“There is only one instance in which we are allowed to look down upon others, when we're offering them help to get back up.”

On Non-Christians, Atheists, Queer People :
“What kind of God would we have if he abandoned his child? Who am I to judge another, when I myself walk as an imperfect man? I do not anger myself at people who follow another religion or no religion at all, because in almost every way we are called by the same voice. That voice calls for all of us to leave this world better than when we entered it. To argue where that voice comes from, whether it be from who I call The One True God and from an atheist, the world itself is a fruitless endeavor as there is just far too much work to do.”  
  
On God’s Grace :
“God doesn’t help you by taking your problems away from you, God grants you the power to face them on your own”  
  
On Politicians :
“I’ve heard many things about how they run business there, I have my opinions. Opinions someone like me probably shouldn’t have! But let’s not gossip child, after all it’s rude to talk about someone who’s listening.”
