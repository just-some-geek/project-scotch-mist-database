### Quotes

Self Introduction:  
“Maya Foker, writer for the school newspaper. I’m not telling you who I am there, I don’t want any trouble.”  
  
On Karma:  
“I don’t agree with the phrase ‘you get what you deserve’. If that was true a lot of people would be some feet under. 6 to be exact.”  
  
On Conversation:  
“People say my words are filled with tangents and flowery bushes, it’s in my nature. Maybe my presence would be felt more if I didn’t say anything at all. That sounds dumb, do you think that sounds dumb?”  
  
On Birds and Names:  
“It’s a childish thought. If I were to become a bird, I would be a sparrow, that’s what Elisabeth told me when we were picking pen names. We were inspired by a novella, Jonathan Lvingston Seagull. Never finished the thing, but the idea of flight. It enamors me. How high could a bird ever-fly?”  
  
On Basilio:  
“The transferee student? He’s interesting, I will tell you that much. He’s so particular about things, particular and articulate. Tall and lanky, but he acts smaller than he is. I personally find it strange, very strange.”
