The Wildflour was a common meeting ground for many students of S.I.U. (Saint Ignatius University). Especially among the more rowdy kinds of students. It was a quite well known establishment which started out as a small bar hidden in some alleyway, but has since become a notable restaurant too. It’s most known for serving food usually only found in higher class restaurants for cheaper price. People were unsure why it was so cheap, maybe it was a supplier issue, but people didn’t complain.
