**Country in the Far East**

The **Eikan Empire** is an archipelagic nation in the Far East, located off the coast of (continent). It controls some territories across the Far East, but asserts its control through alliances and agreements with its aligned nations rather than direct territorial control.

The restoration of imperial power in 1853 kicked off a period of rapid industrialization and modernization, as well as overseas colonization and militarization. A failed military coup against the Emperor in 1868 led to a popular revolt among the peasantry and middle class, turning the nation into the world's first communist state.

The [[Culture of the Eikan Empire]] is defined by its duality. Discipline, order, familial connection, and collective duty are given emphasis in the home and the workplace, but also promotes more radical expression in its popular culture. Eikan food, films, music, art, literature, and comics have gained international acclaim.

Recent geopolitical conflict with the [[Sterlian Commonwealth]] has led to increased militarization in government and society, as well as international isolation. Its government has stated its intentions to "help free the peoples of the Far East from imperialist oppression" through national trade agreements, foreign investment, and alleged support for terrorist and revolutionary groups across the Far East.
