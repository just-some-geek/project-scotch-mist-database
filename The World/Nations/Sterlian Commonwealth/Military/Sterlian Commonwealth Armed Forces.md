**Unified military forces of the Sterlian Commonwealth**

The **Sterlian Commonwealth Armed Forces**, abbreviated as **SCAF**, are the unified military forces responsible for the defense of the [[Sterlian Commonwealth]], its [[Dominions of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Dominions]], and the [[Territories of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Territories]]. They also promote the Commonwealth's wider interests, supporting international peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian aid.

Since the formation of the Kingdom of Sterlia (later succeeded by the Sterlian Empire), the Sterlian Armed Forces have seen action in most major wars involving the Great Powers, including the Seven Years' War, the Bonapartic Wars, the Azovian Intervention, and the [[Great War]]. Following the [[Foundation of the Commonwealth|foundation of the Commonwealth]] in 1933, the disparate military forces of the Sterlian Empire's many constituent nations were federalized and unified into the SCAF. 

The SCAF consist of the Royal Navy, the largest blue-water navy in the world; the Sterlian Army, the Commonwealth's principal land warfare branch; and the Royal Air Force, the most technologically sophisticated air force in the world. SCAF operations are supported by other agencies under the Ministry of Defence, including the Reserves, the Royal Auxiliary, the Constabulary, and others.

King Arthur III, sovereign of the Sterlian Commonwealth, is the commander-in-chief and Head of the Armed Forces, with officers and personnel swearing allegiance to him. Long-standing convention, however, has vested *de facto* power in the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, who make key decisions on the use of the armed forces.

Since the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, elements of the SCAF have been deployed in combat near continuously to conflict zones around the world, most notably in **Iffranika** and the **Far East** as part of the [[Reclamation Wars]].

### History
---
#### Sterlian Empire
During the late 17th to 18th century, the Sterlian Empire sought to contain the expansion of rival powers through military, diplomatic, and commercial means. This saw the Sterlian military engaged in a number of conflicts over colonial possessions and trade access with [[San Sebastian]] and [[Gallia]], most notably the **Seven Years' War** (1756-1763), the **Gallian Revolutionary War** (1792-1802), and the **Bonapartic Wars** (1803-1815). The Royal Navy's victory at the **Battle of Cadizo** (1905) earned the Sterlian Empire total supremacy over the world's oceans, paving the way for an era of peace known as the ***Pax Sterlia***.

The 19th century saw the expansion of the Empire's holdings in Iffranika and Ostesia, as well as conflict with new rivals in the Far East. This period saw Sterlia engage in numerous counter-insurgency campaigns such as the **Mysuti Mutiny** (1840), the **Malouine Insurgency** (1845), and the **Kaapkrieg** (1880), as well as interventions in regional conflicts such as the **Chendai Expedition** (1883), the **Azovian Intervention** (1854-1856), and the **Boxer Expedition** (1900).
#### The Great War
In the early 20th century, the Sterlian Empire was engaged in an arms race with the rest of the Continental powers. 

#### The Reclamation Wars
In the aftermath of the Great War, the remnants of the Sterlian Empire's military forces were scattered across the world.

##### Royal Marines
The Royal Marines are the Navy's specialized troops. These "commando" units are deployed in amphibious, arctic, and mountain warfare, alongside other operations where regular forces may not be sufficient. The Marines are generally self-sufficient, with integrated support units allowing them to operate independently.

#### Sterlian Army
The Sterlian Army is the land component of the SCAF, made up of the Regular Army (or the Regulars) and the part-time Army Reserve.

#### Royal Air Force
The Royal Air Force (RAF) was formed from the merger of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Army's Royal Flying Corps.

The Ministry of Defence maintains several civilian agencies in support of the Sterlian Commonwealth Armed Forces. Though civilian, these play a vital role in supporting SCAF operations and are under military discipline.

- The **Royal Auxiliary Corps** provides most of the SCAF's non-combatant capabilities, including cookery, clerical, medical, mechanical, and intelligence support from the backlines. It was established during the Great War to free up men for frontline duty, and continues to have a majority female workforce to the present (73% female as of 1957).

- The **Royal Constabulary** provides armed security, uniformed policing, counter-intelligence, and investigative services to MoD and SCAF installations across the globe. The RC is also frequently used as a counter-terror and riot control force, deploying to situations where local police are overwhelmed.

- The **Sterlian Equipment Service** is the logistics and procurement arm of the MoD, responsible for the development, procurement, manufacture, and distribution of military equipment to the SCAF. They are also responsible for the distribution of humanitarian aid, though this is frequently used as cover for embezzlement schemes.
