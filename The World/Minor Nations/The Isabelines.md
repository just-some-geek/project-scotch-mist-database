A tropical archipelago in the South Eastern Seas named after Queen Isabella of San Sebastian. Over the last 500 years it’s passed through the hands of many colonizers, including San Sebastian, Sterlia, and Columbia, only gaining its independence 70 years ago after a bloody guerilla war and a tenuous partnership with the Columbias.

  

Economic and political turmoil in the country has led to much of its population seeking education and work overseas, bringing home the technology, expertise, and wealth of the Great Powers.

  

It’s a common joke in Sabelinyo communities that no matter where you are in the world, you only have to say  “Psst!” to find your people.
