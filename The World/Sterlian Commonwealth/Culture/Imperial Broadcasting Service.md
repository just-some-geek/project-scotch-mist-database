#### Sterlian Broadcasting Corporation
The IBS's predecessor, the Sterlian Broadcasting Corporation, was established in 1903 during the merger of **Sterlian Sound**, a major music production label, and **The Daily Courier**, the largest newspaper in the Home Isles. The SBC constituted the mass media arm of the **Media Trust** monopoly, which dominated the flow of information throughout the 1900s and 1910s.

At the onset of the [[The Great War|Great War]], the Sterlian government gained control of the SBC through the [[DORA Act (1914)|DORA Act of 1914]]. While an official state media company already existed at the time, severe underfunding of the Ministry of Public Affairs (now the [[Ministry of Truth]]) forced the acquisition of the company to facilitate wartime censorship and information control measures.

#### Expansion of the IBS
As the [[Sterlian Commonwealth|Sterlian Empire]] expanded its influence across the world, the IBS set up branch offices in Sterlian-controlled territories. These offices are listed below in the order of their establishment.

- **Imperial Broadcasting Hudson-Columbia** (1921-Present; Active). Originally operating as *Imperial Broadcasting West* within the [[Hudsonia|Hudson Bay Territory]], IBS-H/C now controls all IBS operations on the North Columbian continent, including broadcasts in [[Hudsonia]] and [[Columbia]].

- **Imperial Broadcasting Kaapstaat** (1921-Present; Active). IBS-K/A controls operations in [[Kaapstaat]] and the [[North Alkebulan Territories]].

- **Imperial Broadcasting East** (1928-Present; Active). Operating out of **Fort Victoria** on [[Kaigaishima]], IBS-E controls operations throughout the [[Far Eastern Territories]], [[Newstrynia]], [[Shenzhou]], and the [[Eikan Empire]]. The branch expanded significantly after the outbreak of the [[Shenzhou War]], leading to numerous conspiracies about government involvement.

The IBS is divided into eight Services, each one specialized into a particular aspect of the production, processing, and broadcast of the company's programming.
#### Broadcasting Services
The following divisions are the public face of the IBS, each one specializing in a genre of programming that they broadcast to the world.

- **IBS World** (IBS Ch.1). The World Service is the largest branch of the IBS, responsible for the production and dissemination of the news through 22-hour radio and television broadcasts, as well as limited newspaper and magazine publication. These broadcasts are available in the all major languages of the Commonwealth and beyond.
</br>
- **IBS Culture** (IBS Ch.2). The Cultural Service is responsible for the promotion and celebration of quality art, music, and theatre. Many artists recognized by its critics at the annual Proms award ceremony have gone on to have prominent careers in their field. However, these critics are notoriously conservative in their taste, leading to experimental art, as well as those from outside the Commonwealth, to be largely overlooked by the mainstream.
</br>
- **IBS Academic** (IBS Ch.3). The Academic Service provides the Sterlian public with educational programmes on science, technology, nature, history, foreign culture, and a breadth of other topics. Additionally, the service produces short informational films for public service announcements, classrooms, and the [[Sterlian Armed Forces|Sterlian military]].
</br>
- **IBS Entertainment** (IBS Ch.4). The Entertainment Service produces talk shows, movies, comedies, dramas, cartoons, game shows, and a variety of other "pop culture" programmes. Many of these shows have left a signifiant mark on [[Culture of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Sterlian culture]].
</br>
- **IBS Special** (IBS Ch.V). Formed in 1926 as the Experimental Programmes Division, the Special Service focuses on funding 'avant-garde' and 'independent' artists in search of the next big thing. Their greatest success to date was the popularization of the radio drama.
#### Non-Broadcasting Services
These services operate behind the scenes, specializing in programming not intended for rapid broadcast.

- **IBS Archives** (IBS-A). The Archival Service preserves copies of most broadcasts of the IBS, as well as important memorabilia and footage from landmark events, prominent figures, and historically significant news stories.
</br>
- **IBS Productions** (IBS-P). The Production Service is the IBS’s creative arm, making films and music. Many mainstream musicians, actors, and directors laud it for its state-of-the-art facilities and consistently high production quality.
</br>
- **IBS Intelligence** (IBS-I). The Intelligence Division is the IBS’s information-gathering arm. Its wide-reaching network of informants and investigators allow it to stay on top of events and ahead of rival companies and, at times, the Sterlian military.
