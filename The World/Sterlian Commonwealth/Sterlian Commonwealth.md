The **Sterlian Commonwealth**, officially the **Commonwealth of Sterlian Realms** and commonly known as **Sterlia**, is a country in (continent). It is comprised of the core *Home Isles*, the federal *Dominions*, and the outlying *Territories*.

Sterlia became the first industrialized country and was the world's foremost powers during most of the 18th to early 20th centuries. Its sheer dominance in technology, agriculture, industrial capacity, and the strategic positioning of its trading outposts allowed it to control global trade and maintain the balance between the Great Powers during the *Pax Sterlia*.

The passage of the [[Representation Act of 1933]] would transform the overstretched Empire into a "federation of equal states". While the act gave nominal autonomy to the populations of the [[Dominions of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Dominions]] and the outer [[Territories of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Territories]], most regions of the Commonwealth continue to be ruled by a minority government with retained colonial-era government structures and institutions.

The outbreak of the [[The Great War]] was a two-sided affair for Sterlia. The devastating conflict caused a severe economic depression and a widespread immigration crisis, but also opportunities for reconstruction on a global scale. The ensuing [[Reclamation Wars]] saw the Commonwealth intervening in civil conflicts and revolutions across the globe to expand its influence.

A parliamentary crisis in 1953 left the central government paralyzed, 

As of 1957, the Sterlian Commonwealth is at its territorial peak, directly or indirectly controlling almost a third of the world's population and land area. However, the rise of rival powers and independence movements threaten to rip the overstretched nation apart, especially in the outer territories.

## History

Once the Sterlian Empire, the Commonwealth was formed out of a desire to grant greater autonomy and representation to (selected) dominions and territories. For 200 years they have been the conductor of the Imperial Concert, keeping peace and trade between the Great Powers.

Following the end of the Great War, the Commonwealth has tried to occupy and pacify the former territories of the fallen empires to little effect.

  

The Commonwealth espouses liberty, equality, and democracy, though in practice they largely fail. Classism, sexism, and racism severely strain the social fabric, especially in the farther reaches of the nation.

  

The political deadlock in Parliament, as well as the merely ceremonial powers of the monarchy, means that no real changes can pass through the Commonwealth. This has led to thoughts of independence, or at least greater autonomy, in the Territories (especially Kaigaishima).

  

#### Far Eastern Territories

The Far Eastern Territories, comprising the Kaigaishima, Chendai, and New Island territories, are some of Sterliaâ€™s most important possessions.

  

#### The Dominions: Hudsonia, Kaapstadt, New Ulistralie, and the Princedom

I dunno, call the capital of Ulistralie (Not-Australia) Ozbourne
