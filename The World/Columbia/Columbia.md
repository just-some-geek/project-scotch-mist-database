To the rest of the world, the Federation of Columbia represents the dream of utopia: a shining city on the hill, where all men are made equal, where all are at liberty to pursue happiness in their lives. Its people live in luxury, able to relish in the endless pleasures of food, clothing, media, and music. Its lands are rich in beauty and resources that few other nations can compare to. It is, to put it simply, the greatest nation on Earth.

The reality, however, is far darker. Columbia is a nation run by cartels, cabals, and trusts. Its empire is built on not only conquest, but the relentless pursuit of capital. Its elite are opportunists, feeding on the carcasses of the Great Powers and carving out its empire not with lines on the map, but the hearts and minds of the people.
