## Etymology
---
The name "Kaigaishima" is an [[Eikan Empire|Eikan]] exonym meaning "foreign island", reflecting its recent colonization by the Empire at the time of the initial Sterlian contact.
## History
---
Major human presence in the [[Chendai Archipelago]] is first dated to about 6000 years ago, during the **Middle Neolithic**. The semi-coastal **Shen** people built the first settlements along the [[Shenzhou]] coast. Artifacts from the northern region of the island indicates rice cultivation and agriculture around this time as well.

Around 200 BCE, the settlements on Kaigaishima were integrated into the **Shen Empire**, bringing it into the fold of the wider continental system. By the time of the **Zhou Dynasty**, the archipelago was under the control of a few prominent families.

The earliest known Western visitors came in the early 1500s, when [[San Sebastian|Sebastiano]] explorer **Miguel de los Alvarez** met with a local (*Chinese word for regional lord*).

## Geography
---
Kaigaishima is the largest, central island of the [[Chendai Archipelago]], surrounded on all sides by the {Name Sea}. 

Urban development on the island is highly concentrated in the south, central, and western regions, with the north and east being more suburban or rural.

#### Climate
Kaigaishima has a humid subtropical climate, with long, hot, and humid summers capped by the June-August monsoon season. The island is frequently hit by typhoons, which cause landslides and flooding. Winters are short and mild, with snowfall being an extremely rare occurence. Cold fronts from the mainland will sometimes cause extremely chilly and foggy weather, known locally as the "scotch mist".

Due to the industrial development of the West region, as well as the recent proliferation of automobiles, air pollution is a significant issue on the island. Air quality indexes frequently reach upwards of 100 ppm of pollutants during peak hours in the spring.
#### Architecture
Kaigaishima's architecture, like its geography, is divided along the banks of the **Twin Rivers**.

The rural northern areas are littered with small villages built in the traditional Eikan style, 

The southern island is dominated by large informal housing complexes built from wood, paper, and sheet metal.

#### Political reforms and sociopolitical issues
Kaigaishima is governed by a minority regime not fully representative of the island's population. Members of the Legislative Council are elected by professional, corporate, and special interest groups and not the general public.

Ethnic minorities (except those of Continental ancestry, such as Sterlians and Sebastianos) have negligible representation in government and often experience discrimination in housing, education, and employment. Vacancies and applications frequently require fluency in several languages which most minority job seekers do not meet, and resources remain inadequate for learners.

Foreign workers, such as [[The Isabelines|Sabelinyos]] and other immigrants from the Far East, have little protection under regional law. Although they reside within the territory, these workers are not considered residents and do not have the protections such a status offers.

Human trafficking is also an issue. Locals, mainland Shenzhen, and foreigners have been trafficked for sex in brothels, homes, and businesses in the city.
## Economy
---
As one of the world's largest commercial ports and the main Sterlian financial center outside of the Home Isles, Kaigaishima has a service-based market economy, characterized by low taxation, minimal government intervention, and deeply entrenched international financial market.

## Culture

*Main Article: Culture of Kaigaishima*

Kaigaishiman culture is characterized by a hybrid of East and West. Traditional [[Culture of Shenzhou|Shenzhen]] and [[Culture of the Eikan Empire|Eikan]] values emphasizing higher education, spirituality, and the nuclear family are blended with [[Culture of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Sterlian]] ideals of individual liberties and the rule of law. The island's colonial history and strategic location, combined with immigration from the [[Far Eastern Territories]], has resulted in a distinct local identity.
#### Cuisine
Kaigaishiman cuisine is a fusion of the cuisines of its population groups.

#### Language
There are three main languages used in Kaigishima: Sterlian, Eikan, and Lower Shenzhen.

#### Media
Kaigaishima is home to [[Imperial Broadcasting Service]] East, 



#### Sport and Recreation
Despite its small area, the island is home to a variety of sports and recreational facilities.

The **Albertine Valley Country Club** holds a near-monopoly over the island's legal gambling market, which generates over 370 million Sterling every year. As casinos are banned on the island, the AVCC generates income through lotteries, sports betting, and horse racing. The annual **Prince Albert Stakes**, part of the Commonwealth Cup series, reportedly draws over 10,000 attendees.

The island also has an active nightlife scene. Many eateries and caf√©s in the **Lasky** district stay open until midnight to cater to students and office workers, and the density of nightclubs and motels in **Nemui** make it the largest red-light district in the Commonwealth.

Several historic facilities and locations are operated or regulated by the Sterlian government, including the **Hoshiyama Nature Reserve**, the **Hioki Onsen**, the **Royal Museum of the East**, and the **Imperial Botanical Gardens**. These are generally open to the public year-round through public funding and generous private donations.
## Education

*Main Article: Education in Kaigaishima*

Education in Kaigaishima is largely modelled on that of the [[Sterlian Commonwealth]], particularly the **Sterlian System**. Children are required to attend school in two stages: primary education at age 6. and secondary education at age 18. Upon completion of secondary education, all students take the [[Sterlian Civil Service Examination]] and are certified for both tertiary education and government service.

Mandatory education on Kaigaishima has resulted in the highest literacy rate in the Far Eastern Territories at 89.9%, though this number is diminished by the influx of refugees from the [[Shenzhou]] mainland as a result of the [[Shenzhou War]].
#### Medium of Instruction
**Sterlian** is the official medium of instruction at all levels of education, keeping with the administration's "Common Language for the Commonwealth" policy.

Secondary schools emphasize bi-literacy and multilingualism, encouraging

#### Tertiary Education
Kaigaishima has three universities. [[St. Ignatius University]] (SIU) was founded as the island's first institute of higher education during the early colonial period in 1859 by [[San Sebastian|Sebastiano]] missionaries. While initially a small private institution, it was eventually expanded and granted university status in 1898.

[[Paul Miki University]] (PMU) was established in 1908 to provide higher education to the general public, using Shenzhen as its primary language of instruction. It, alongside the **Imperial University of the Far East**, provides access to affordable higher education to the masses.

Together, the three universities are ranked as the top universities in the Far East, drawing in several prominent foreign students who would go on to play major roles in their home countries.
