# Districts By Region
---
## North Region
The North Region largely resembles the rural regions of [[Eikan Empire|Eiko]], with small villages nestled in the Hoshiyama mountain range and along the coastline, as well as large palace-estates for the [[Sterlian Commonwealth|Sterlian]] and [[Eikan Empire|Eikan]] aristocracy. The region is primarily residential, though some commercial hubs exists towards the eastern parts of the region.
##### **Sakamoto**
- 坂本, *base of the hill*
- Neighboring the **Hoshiyama Nature Reserve**, the district is home to the **Sakamoto Shrine** temple complex, from which the area gets its name. The area's remote villages have recently seen an influx of wealthier residents, with some being converted to private estates.
##### **Hioki**
- 日置, *sunset*
- The district is known for its mountainside views and strong geothermal activity, tapped into by the **Hoshiyama Geothermal Plant** which generates a significant portion of the island's energy. The nearby **Hioki Onsen** provides a relaxing hot spring paired with a wide view of the city and the reserve.
##### **Uehara**
- 上原, *upper plain*
- A small agricultural population maintains the vast paddies of the district, providing Kaigaishiman cuisine with a uniquely glutinous variety of rice. Attempts by the government and major corporations to industrialize the region have generally failed.
##### **Hachinosu** 
- 蜂の巣, *beehive*
- The district's wide open flower fields provide ample grazing space for cattle and honeybees, which provide the island with the finest tripe and honey. It's said that cooking with the region's signature ingredients can cure any illness, as long as it's a cold.
##### **Kusunoki**
- 楠木, *camphor tree*
- The area is known for its traditional medicine and cosmetics manufacturing, as well as the **Kusunoki Riverside** shopping street. The ancient camphorwood trees lend a refined elegance to the district and those who purchase its products.
##### **Takanabe** 
- 高鍋, *high office*
- The district is home to the [[Albertine Valley Country Club]], the monopolizing titan of Kaigaishima's gambling industry. The upper classes and the staff of the Admiralty are known to frequent the area, discretionarily spending on golf courses, pools, casinos, cricket, football, and horse racing.
##### **Nemui**
- 眠い, *sleep*
- The largest red-light district in the Commonwealth, frequented by university students and faculty, businessmen, and high-profile politicians. The area's cafés serve decently filling meals at a fair price, though tips are expected for the excellent service.
##### **Heisei**
- 平成, *achieving peace*
- The area's tall beacon tower has helped Eikan sailors navigate to Kaigaishima's port since time immemorial. Recently, the tower was integrated into the newly-built **Heisei Stadium**, which serves as a key waypoint in many Eikan League baseball team's careers.
## Central Region
The Central Region is the bustling heart of Kaigaishima and, by extension, the Far Eastern Territories. Its expansive commercial and business districts account for a significant
##### **St. Paul**
- The district is one of the two college towns on Kaigaishima, housing the government-run [[Paul Miki University|Paul Miki University (PMU)]]. The large university has had an outsized influence in the city center, to the point that the Constabulary regularly pulls 24-hour shifts to keep politically active students from rioting.
##### **St. Ignatius**
- Missionaries from [[San Sebastian]] constructed the St. Ignatius Cathedral and the attached [[St. Ignatius University]] in this area during the early colonial period to educate the children of the newly-formed aristocracy. The university has undergone some secularization in recent years, and its students have become more politically active as spurred on by their rival, PMU.
##### **Tsuno**
- 都濃, *dense capital*
- The district is known to locals as "Little Lasky" due to its resemblance to the city center, housing a large park and shrine on its northern island, as well as a large shopping complex and the second-largest train station on Kaigaishima. Despite this, tourists still prefer staying in Lasky due to the more central location and lower cost of living.
##### **Ikime**
- 生目, *eye of life*
- The area is one of Kaigaishima's many business districts, housing the local headquarters of several major Eikan and Sterlian corporations. Incidentally, most of the district's land was reclaimed from the river through funding from those same corporations.

##### **Isoichi**
- 磯市, *beach town*
- The coastal district is home to ludicrously expensive beachfront properties and high rises and very little else. The high cost of living in the district means that the citizens who live here are either the new-blooded upper class or the people who work directly for them.
##### **Lasky**
- The beating heart of Kaigaishima, to which all roads (and rail lines) lead. An entire district dedicated to celebrating life through good music, great food, and even better architecture. The **Benedict Lasky Station** is the centerpiece of the area, a large Victorian-style building around which those who party too hard tend to cluster. It's common courtesy to leave them some water and food for the hangover.
##### **Taylor**
- A district dedicated to the fine arts, both ancient and upcoming. Local fine arts students frequently gather around the statue of art legend **Joshua Taylor** to hone their craft and waiting for inspiration. The local branch of the Sterlian Museum, named the **Sterlian Museum of the East**, was built here to house artifacts too large to ship back to the Home Isles.
##### **Henshaw**
- The district is largely built around the imposing [[Admiralty Park]], a collection of buildings that serve as the headquarters for the [[Sterlian Commonwealth Armed Forces]] in the Far East. The small chapel sitting across the street houses a memorial to **Samantha Henshaw**, a field nurse from Kaigaishima who became famous for her life-saving work during the [[Great War]].

##### **Eastwood** 
- Once the eastern half of the Great Woods district, this sprawling residential area is filled with detatched single-family homes climbing the steep western slope of [[Hoshiyama Nature Reserve#Mt. Hoshi|Mt. Hoshi]]. Residents of the district, as well as neighboring Westwood, are given large discounts on rides on the [[Kaigai Metro]].
##### **Westwood** 
- The western half of the former Great Woods district, little remains of the once-thriving pine-logging industry that defined the area. However, the distinct smell of varnished Kaigai pinewood still permeates the air through the district's resurging furniture industry.
##### **Kolbe** 
- The former district is named after Maximillian Kolbe, Catholic saint who sacrificed himself in the Holocaust for 13 other men. A lot of business.

- 中和, *neutralization*
- 
##### **Miyamura** 
- The great cranes of the [[Miyamura Aviation and Shipping Enterprises|M.A.S.E.]] complex tower over the sprawling dockyard facilities beneath.

It also includes a Special Economic Zone, wherein foreign companies operate without local restrictions.

##### **Horikoshi**
