**Currency of the Sterlian Commonwealth**

The **sterling** is the official currency of the [[Sterlian Commonwealth]] and some allied countries, and is the second most commonly held reserve currency after the {*Columbian dollar*}. It is the oldest currency still in use, adopted in the early 600s. Its signature non-decimal denominations were phased out in 1937, and the modern sterling is divided into 100 pence each.

Currently circulating denominations include 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-pence and 1- and 2-sterling coins, as well as 5-, 10-, 20-, and 50-sterling banknotes. Some commemorative coins with unique denominations are also in circulation, though these are generally worth more than their face value.
