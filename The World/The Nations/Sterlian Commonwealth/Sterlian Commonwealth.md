The **Commonwealth of Sterlian Realms**, known colloquially as **Sterlia** or the **Sterlian Commonwealth**, is a federation of states of the former **Sterlian Empire**. It is comprised of the [[Great Sterlia|Sterlian Home Isles]], the federalized [[Dominions of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Dominions]], and the outlying [[Territories of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Territories]], representing approximately 37% of the world's habitable land area. 

Sterlia became the first industrialized country and was the world's foremost power for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly during the *Pax Sterlinica* between 1815 and 1914. This period saw the Sterlian Empire dominate in science and technology, agriculture, trade, and military affairs and become the largest empire in history. However, its involvement in the [[Great War]] and the ensuing [[Reclamation Wars]] significantly damaged its economic power and strained its relations with the rest of the world. The Empire would be reorganized into the Commonwealth in 1933, marking an era of reconstruction and economic prosperity, but an economic crash in 1953 and the following political crisis would cascade into a series of crises that the Commonwealth is yet to recover from.

The Sterlian Commonwealth is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy, a developed nation with an advanced manufacturing- and service-based economy, and a preeminent military power. The Commonwealth also exercises a large amount of soft power influence, with [[Culture of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Sterlian culture]] being influential in language, literature, music, and sport. As a great power, the Commonwealth is the leader of a number of international organizations and forums, most notably the **Council of Nations**.

As of 1957, the Sterlian Commonwealth is at its breaking point. The union faces increasing civil unrest, especially in the outer territories, due to economic downturn, socioeconomic inequality, a radicalizing civil rights movement, and growing distrust of the government following the [[Parliamentary Crisis of 1953]] and Sterlia's continued involvement in the [[Shenzhou War]]. Foreign actors and independence movements threaten to tear the Commonwealth apart, while corruption within its own ranks leaves Sterlia unable to properly respond.

# History

Sterlia became the first industrialized country and was the world's foremost powers during most of the 18th to early 20th centuries. Its sheer dominance in technology, agriculture, industrial capacity, and the strategic positioning of its trading outposts allowed it to control global trade and maintain the balance between the Great Powers during the *Pax Sterlinia*.

The passage of the [[Representation Act of 1933]] would transform the overstretched Empire into a "federation of equal states". While the act gave nominal autonomy to the populations of the [[Dominions of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Dominions]] and the outer [[Territories of the Sterlian Commonwealth|Territories]], most regions of the Commonwealth continue to be ruled by a minority government with retained colonial-era government structures and institutions.

The outbreak of the [[Great War]] was a two-sided affair for Sterlia. The devastating conflict caused a severe economic depression and a widespread immigration crisis, but also opportunities for reconstruction on a global scale. The ensuing [[Reclamation Wars]] saw the Commonwealth intervening in civil conflicts and revolutions across the globe to expand its influence.

A [[Parliamentary Crisis of 1953|parliamentary crisis]] in 1953 left the central government paralyzed, with the conservative **Unionist Party** and the centre-left **Labour Party** deadlocking any legislative progress. This has raised tensions all over the Commonwealth, with increasing calls for expanded civil rights, home rule, and in some cases, independence from the "Sterlian oppressors".


The Commonwealth espouses liberty, equality, and democracy, though in practice they largely fail. Classism, sexism, and racism severely strain the social fabric, especially in the farther reaches of the nation.

  

The political deadlock in Parliament, as well as the merely ceremonial powers of the monarchy, means that no real changes can pass through the Commonwealth. This has led to thoughts of independence, or at least greater autonomy, in the Territories (especially Kaigaishima).
