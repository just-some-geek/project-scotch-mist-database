**Bonapartic-era bastion fortress**

**Fort Valkyrie** is a castle and historical stronghold in [[Districts of Kaigaishima|Yilan, Kaigaishima]]. Situated atop **Valkyrie Peak**, the fortress once served as the main base for the [[Sterlian Commonwealth Armed Forces|Sterlian garrison]] on [[Kaigaishima]]. After the end of the [[Great War]], the garrison transferred to the newly acquired East District and control of the fort was transferred to the [[Imperial Broadcasting Service]] Eastern Division.

The fort is constructed in the style of a {*European*} bastion or star fortress, with modifications made to adapt the structure to the relatively narrow geography of Valkyrie Peak. 

### History

#### Initial Construction
A

#### Great War
Though Sterlia, Eiko, and Shenzhou were all involved in the fighting in the Far East, Kaigaishima never came under direct attack during the Great War. As such, Fort Valkyrie was primarily used as a supply depot and training facility for troops being transported through the island going to the Shenzhou front.

The proliferation of civilian radios during the war prompted the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry of Public Affairs]] to construct a broadcast tower within the fort to facilitate radio and television broadcasts.
#### Conversion to IBS Facility
Following the end of the Great War in 1928, the Kaigaishiman colonial government acquired the nearby island of Higashijima (lit. *East Island*) from Shenzhou. The island, now Kaigaishima's East District, was converted into a major military installation, leaving facilities on the island proper open for new residents.

The size, location, and existing infrastructure made the fort an optimal location for the recently-nationalized IBS East to expand their operations.
