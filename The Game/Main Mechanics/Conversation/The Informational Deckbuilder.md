### Obtaining Information Cards
---
**Information Cards** are items that represent data about a particular topic of conversation, whether it be a person, location, event, idea, or any number of other things. These aren't physical objects the player can hold, but rather "files" which appear during conversational encounters in the dedicated menu.

Generally speaking, information can be obtained in three ways:
1) Exploring the island and discovering locations, 
2) Talking with the people on the island and learning about them, and
3) Consuming in-universe media.

All obtained information cards can be accessed at any time through the menu.
### Engaging in Conversation
---
Certain story-important dialogue throughout the game will be represented by **Conversation Encounters**. These are puzzle like scenarios 

Information cards carry a certain point value that contributes to the score, but repeated use reduces its effectiveness for the rest of the conversation.
### Stats, Skills, and Overcharge
---
The System uses six statistics, each representing a different characteristic important in conversations. In general, these are used to give the last push you need to convince a person

| Stat | Name        | Represents                                                         |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| WIS  | Wisdom      | Theoretical knowledge, creative thinking, and out-of-the-box ideas |
| CHA  | Charisma    | Charm, subtlety, and duplicitous action                            |
| PER  | Perception  | Situational awareness, empathy, and intuition                      |
| PRO  | Proficiency | Technical skill, practical applications, and reflexes              |
| RES  | Resolve     | Physical presence, mental fortitude, and sheer aura                |
| COM  | Composure   | Professionalism, courage, and commitment to the bit                |

### Stress and Biases
---
**Biases** are modifiers representing a character's personality, making them more receptive or resistant to certain styles of communication. 

A comprehensive list of Biases can be found [[List of Modifiers in the Informational Deckbuilder|here]].

**Stress** is the primary ticking timer in an encounter.
