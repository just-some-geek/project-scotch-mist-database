In a similar fashion to ATLUS games (Persona and Metaphor), the game takes place in a set time period with players experiencing the game day by day, with different activities to perform during each phase of the day. Certain activities will only be available during certain day phases and/or seasons, so players must carefully manage the limited time they have.

The game takes place between the dates of 1 June 1957 and 6 May 1958. Every day of the game is divided into six four-hour phases, laid out as such:

| Phase          | Midnight    | Early Morning | Morning     | Noon        | Afternoon   | Evening     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Time (24H)** | 2200 - 0159 | 0200 - 0559   | 0600 - 0959 | 1000 - 1359 | 1400 - 1759 | 1800 - 2159 |
