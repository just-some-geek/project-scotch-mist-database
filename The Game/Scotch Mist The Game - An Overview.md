**An Introduction to the Mechanics and Systems of Scotch Mist**

Scotch Mist's gameplay mechanics are largely inspired by, or rather carcinized into, typical JRPG mechanics.

### Calendar

> *Main Article: [[The Calendar System]]*

In a similar fashion to the ATLUS games (Persona and Metaphor), the game takes place in a set time period with players experiencing the game day by day, with different activities to perform during each phase of the day. Certain activities will only be available during certain day phases and/or seasons, so players must carefully manage the limited time they have.

The game takes place between the dates of 1 June 1957 and 6 May 1958. Every day of the game is divided into six four-hour phases, laid out as such:

| Phase          | Midnight    | Early Morning | Morning     | Noon        | Afternoon   | Evening     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Time (24H)** | 2200 - 0159 | 0200 - 0559   | 0600 - 0959 | 1000 - 1359 | 1400 - 1759 | 1800 - 2159 |
### Confidant

Players must connect with the people of Kaigaishima to progress the game through a fusion of Persona's Social Link/Confidant system and Fallout's Reputation system. Increased levels of reputation with certain people and groups grants access to certain items, locations, and information, and may trigger certain unique events and quests.

Due to the island's intricate web of inter-faction interactions, increasing your reputation with certain people and groups may also affect your standing with others, positively and negatively.
### Conversation

The Informational Deckbuilder(TM) is the system at the heart of Scotch Mist. As they explore the game's world and engage with its characters, players will learn pieces of information that may be important in future conversations. 

Certain story-significant conversations are "combat encounters" where players must use the information and skills they've gathered to achieve a particular goal, such as gathering important intelligence, calling in a favor, or getting out of trouble with particular people.
