Overview : 

Runner of the local broadcasting service and radio, who may or may not have a partnership with the Kingfishers to report out their stories on air. Grew up in unfortunate circumstances but has made a career for herself out of sheer determination and will. Has a charismatic personality on air and with strangers to put up a friendly facade for the sake of being nice, but in reality is quite troubled.

Equal parts girlboss and girlypop

An optional task to give her Damian’s vinyls to play on air, which can now be accessed via radio stations across the island.
