A mostly non-essential NPC, who functions as a stand-in for myself [Emong]. He'll offer to chat with the character's and give them fun lore drops and 4th wall breaks. In his bar, he will offer you to play music from his vinyl collection saying he feels the music he listens to is “relevant” and “of the times”. He will also offer you pieces of lore and hints for special collectibles you can find around the island. Implied that he is the god of this world.
