Opinion On : 

  
The Island - “I absolutely love this place! The food, the places, the people… It’s all just so fascinating. Definitely one of the top 2 places I’ve ever visited, and it’s not number 2 I’ll tell you that.”

  
Herself [Regular] - “I’d say I’m pretty alright for the most part.”  
  
Herself [Honest] - “Just someone who doesn’t really know where she’s going honestly. I tried living in the capital but it just wasn’t for me, you know?”

  
Basilio - “Oh Basilio? His name is quite hard to pronounce, don't you think? So many syllables so quickly. He’s quite the pleasant presence to be around, however he can be so quiet sometimes.”

  
Olivia - “Ms. Northwind is an odd person, she seems so caught up in her work. It’s hard to get to her. She spends more time with a cigarette in her hand than she does sleeping.”

  
Leo - “He looks like he hasn’t seen a good wink of sleep in ages, you feel bad for him sometimes but he’s a very capable person. Incredibly sweet if you get to know the guy.”

  
  

  
Joseph - “Very well spoken and has people’s best interests at heart. I wish him the best in all of his endeavors, I really do.”
