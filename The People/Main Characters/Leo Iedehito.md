College is a great place to reinvent yourself…  
  
Overview :  
  
Leo Detahito is an illegal immigrant from Eiko who finds himself on a cargo ship en route to Kaigaishima. He had grown tired of his nation's rampant xenophobia and imperialism, so he decided to take himself elsewhere. Somewhere he could feel safer.  
  
Luckily for him, he managed to nab the documents necessary to apply for scholarship in the island’s 2nd best university PMU, granting him a free dormitory to live in. Granted he’d then have to attend classes and not fail, but he believes he could survive. These documents came from his friend the real Leo Detahito, Leo Alpha allowed this Leo to take his name to use. His real name is unknown.  
  
Electrical engineering seemed difficult, but he had experience with fixing radio and other appliances in his community.  
  
Opinion On : 

  
The Island - “I need a place to be, this feels like a good spot.”

  
Themselves - “I’m unsure, have you ever been unsure before? There’s a lot more I need to figure out first before I can answer that, sorry.”

  
Basilio - “He explained to me how the trains worked here. He speaks like he’s the smartest person in the room, but not in a cocky way. I often go to him when I need to know things.”

  
Olivia - “I know she means well I know she means well but she has that look. I don't know if I'm getting pity or what, but she doesn't feel right.”
  
Joseph - “I don't really understand what he wants sometimes, he's got a lot going on.”  
  
Character Arc :  
  
Leo never really had a terrible childhood, but there were many compounding things in life that never sat right with him. The nation he lived in, Eiko, while prospering in many ways materially had issues that he could not live with. Its rampant nationalism and racism was apparent, its strict hold on tradition and family made it hard for young people to just be. After he caught wind of the nation's plans to start a war of conquest, it was the straw that broke the camel's back for him.  
  
So he decided to flee the country, something that for some reason he was quite confident in. He plotted his course to Kaigaishima, an island that he felt was reachable due to it being a trade hub between Eiko and the Commonwealth. He felt a lot safer there, however he also knew that there was a chance that the island would be included in Eiko’s war, so Kaigaishima could also be used as a jumping off point to other countries such as Isabela/The Isabelines.  
  
The plan was to hide themselves in an empty wooden crate that had holes in them and ship himself on his way to Kaigaishima. He had also obtained documents through undisclosed sources that made him a scholar to the University of Paul Miki. This allowed him a safe place to live for the foreseeable years, as well as an education to give him job opportunities down the line. Granted he’d have to succeed in class, but the degree was for electrical engineering, something he felt confident in as he was his community's handyman for electrical appliances.  
  

He could be accompanied by a friend or two he wants to save, whether they end up on Kaigaishima with him or accidentally get shipped off somewhere else is to be determined.
