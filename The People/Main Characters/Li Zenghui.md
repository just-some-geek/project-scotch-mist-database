Overview :  
  
Li Joseph Zenghui is a native to Kaigaishima who is returning after studying/working abroad. He returns to the island hoping to bring social and political change to better the people there. Granted the opportunity to study abroad via a scholarship from the Commonwealth he gladly took it. Since then he’s been on a grand tour of Europa studying and working between universities.  
  
After a well spent 5 years he’s learnt a lot on his travels, be it biology, physics, but more importantly philosophy and economic theories. He still thought about his homeland throughout those years and he figured that some of the knowledge he’s acquired could be useful back home.  
  
His ideas can be seen as radical by some, but needless to say he is confident in what he believes in.

Character Arc : 

  

After studying abroad for 10 years, Li Zenghui, who went by the name of Joseph Li, returns to his home island of Kaigaishima. He still uses the name Joseph around people who might not be able to pronounce Zenghui. His intentions are to use his connections back home to start highschool in the Southern Island to improve the education of his local community.  
  
During the process, he comes to know Olivia during a fancy dinner to commemorate the opening of Saint Florence Hospital in Wanhua district. They end up next to each other on the arranged seating and have a very “productive” conversation about the state of the island. From there Olivia becomes a frequent correspondent of Joseph from which he asks permits to get the high school off the ground. As well as general community upliftment, despite it going against government policy. On the side he spends a lot of time with the local community doing his best to help out.  
  

This in turn gains him notoriety with many organizations within the island which open up new opportunities for him.  
  
However a pipe bomb is sent to the admiralty’s office and Joseph’s name was placed as the sender. Obviously he didn’t fucking do it, but he is then arrested for 14 days until he is executed by firing squad. His epilogue is a funeral scene held somewhere far away, with a man saying a eulogy in his honor.  
  
A secret ending can be achieved by manipulating people on the inside of the Sterlian army to get your men on the firing squad. Zenghui fakes his own death and the eulogy is instead delivered by him. Absolutely not canon, but it’s funny as hell.

  
Epilogue is Mi Ultimo Adios
